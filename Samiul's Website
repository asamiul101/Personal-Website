  <pre>
  <em><strong>CUNY HACKATHON 2019</strong></em> 				      Baruch College of the City University of New York
    My team of 5 from CCNY built an application named “Seen Share”, where users can upload pictures of various locations and it can also execute that exact address and routes to go there by utilizing Google Places API. My responsibility was to connect Google Places API with our software via python so that it can easily execute the exact location and routes which I was able to achieve.

  <em><strong><a href="https://github.com/samiularnob12/Game-of-Life/commit/0704e65e326da997729c0b9d21ee529910e371b8">GAME OF LIFE</a></strong></em>
    I developed an application using C++ where the cells are in a square environment where it will die if it does not have 3 or 2 neighbour cells around it. However, there is in the empty spaces the cells will come to life if they have 3 neighbouring cells. So, the numbers of cells change over the generation where cells will die and come to live.

  <em><strong><a href="https://github.com/samiularnob12/SpaceAttack/blob/main/Space%20Attack">DESIGN AND CODE OF SPACE INVADER GAME</a></strong></em>
    I made a game using pygame where a user rides a spaceship and shoots down other enemy spaceships to get points.
